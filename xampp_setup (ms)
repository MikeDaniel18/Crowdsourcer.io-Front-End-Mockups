XAMPP/APACHE setup for Windows

If you asking 'why do I have to do it' then the simple answer is to setup your local server and view php files (yes we are working on those).

I. Downloading XAMPP and copying files.

1.Download from here: https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html.
2.Unpack, install (pay attention where you install it).
3.In the installation directory you will find folder 'htdocs'.
4.Clone/download 'Crowdsourcer.io-Front-End-Mockups' repository.
5.Copy the repo folder into 'htdocs' directory of Xampp (most probably C:\xampp if you just clicked your way through installation).

<now you have all the documents in the right place - we will start xampp>

II. Setting up XAMPP

6.In search bar (Windows Start) type "Xampp control panel" and click it.
7.You will see a window with listed items on the left - we are concerned about only two: Apache, MySQL.
8.Click 'start' for both Apache and MySQL.
9.Start your web browser and type in the adress bar "http://localhost".
10. If you see official website of XAMPP - you're good to go.

<we want to start using XAMPP now>

III. Reading 'hello world'

11.To see a php file you have to navigate to it - using adress bar of your browser.
12.Type 'http://localhost/*/', where * is the name of the folder you pasted the repository into.
   (I pasted 'Crowdsourcer.io-Front-End-Mockups' repository into a new folder 'crowd' in 'htdocs' so for me it is
   'http://localhost/crowd/' )
13.You should now see a big Hello World in h1 and instructions on how to use the downloaded repo.
14.Get busy reading... and welcome.
